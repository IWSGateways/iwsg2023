        <p>Tübingen is a popular town with sometimes very limited availability of hotel rooms. Therefore finalize your travel plans 
		as soon as possible and book a room!</p> 
	<p>We were able to organize a limited contingent of hotel rooms in Tübingen. The <a href="https://www.hotel-domizil.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Hotel Domizil </a>
		is located directly beside the Neckar river less than 5 minutes walking distance from the conference venue. The apartments 
		offered through <a href="http://www.cloudno7.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Cloud No. 7 </a> are similarly just around the corner.</p>
	<p>For booking please contact them through <a href="mailto:info@hotel-domizil.de"> info@hotel-domizil.de</a> or <a href="mailto:operations@studios.cloudno7.de"> operations@studios.cloudno7.de</a> and refer to IWSG2023. Please 
		directly provide the usual base information like name, length of your stay, room type, billing address, etc.</p>
	 <p>Please note that the contingents are only available till 10.05.2023 or 15.05.2023, respectively.</p>
