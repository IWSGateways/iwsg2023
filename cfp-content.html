   <p>Science Gateways support scientists along the stages of the research cycle 
      covering data collection and annotation, processing and analysis of complex 
      scientific data as well as collaborative work and publication of research 
      data. They bridge community and domain specific expertise with modern information 
      technologies such as Internet of Things, Big Data Analytics, Artificial 
      Intelligence and hybrid Cloud environments. Through them scientists are enable 
      to tap the full potential of their scientific data.</p>
